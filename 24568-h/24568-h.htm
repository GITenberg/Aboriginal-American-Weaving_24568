<p>Wonderful as is the development of modern machinery for the
manufacture of American textiles&mdash;machinery which seems
almost human in the way it converts raw materials into finished
cloth; just as surprising are the most primitive looms of the
American aborigines, who without the aid of machinery make
interesting weavings with only a bar upon which to suspend the
warp threads while the human hand completes all the processes
of manufacture. Modern man's inventive genius in the textile
art has been expended upon perfecting the machinery, while
primitive man's ingenuity has resulted in making a beautiful
weaving with very simple means.</p>

<p>No doubt could we know the history of primitive loom work<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
in America prior to the coming of the white man, we would find
an extended distribution of weaving, but all early textiles have
been lost owing to the destructability of the material and the
lack of climatic and other conditions suitable for their preservation&mdash;conditions
such as are present in the hot desert lands
of the Southwest and the coast region of Peru. However, so
many impressions of weavings have been found on early pottery
as to assure us that beautiful work of this kind was made in
eastern, middle and southern United States. In western British
Columbia at the present time there are tribes carrying on certain
forms of weaving which show four interesting types.</p>

<p class="caption">FIGURE 1.&mdash;KWAKIUTL SQUAW, WEAVING.</p>

<p>The simplest type is the cedar bark mat woven of flat strips
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>in horizontal and vertical lines. In beginning wide strips of the
inner bark are hung from their centre over a crossbar of wood
which is supported at either end by an upright beam. The
halves of the strips hanging in front are then split into strands of
the desired width and a line of fine twining woven across to hold
them securely. The checker weaving of the mat is now begun at
the left edge by doubling the weft element over the last warp and
then weaving with the doubled element over and under one warp
until the right edge is reached where it is turned back and
slipped under an inch of the weaving just completed. <a href="#figure1">Figure 1</a>
shows a squaw at work on such a mat, and when she has completed
this half of the mat the second half will be undertaken. She
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>finishes the edge by turning up the warp ends below the last
line of weft and binds them with a row of twining just above this
last weft.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a name="figure2" id="figure2"></a><a href="images/figure2.jpg"><img src="images/figure2_th.jpg"
alt="Mat with checked design" title="Mat with checked design" /></a></p>

<p class="caption">FIGURE 2.&mdash;MAT WITH CHECKED DESIGN.</p>

<p>In their industries, primitive people always utilize the materials
found in their environment, because no means is afforded them,
as in modern life, for the transportation of materials from a distance.
British Columbia is rich in cedar trees, so it is not
strange that material from this tree enters so largely into the
weaving of this region. Cedar bark lends itself very delightfully
to the technic of these mats, and its golden brown checked
surface is at times crossed by black lines or broken by a group
of black checks in simple designs. These vary greatly, but
only one example (<a href="#figure2">Figure 2</a>) can be shown here.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a name="figure3" id="figure3"></a><a href="images/figure3.jpg"><img src="images/figure3_th.jpg"
alt="Primitive loom with plaited mat" title="Primitive loom with plaited mat" /></a></p>

<p class="caption">FIGURE 3.&mdash;PRIMITIVE LOOM WITH PLAITED MAT.</p>

<p>The second type of weaving, also of cedar bark, is begun like
the last mat, but the elements are so placed as to cross the surface
diagonally&mdash;alternate strips passing diagonally downward
to the right and left as in <a href="#figure3">Figure 3</a>. These strips are not woven
but plaited over and under each other without the addition of a
weft element as in weaving. When the side edge is reached
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>the strips turn over at right angles and continue to plait in the
changed oblique direction. The lower edges are finished by
bending the elements at right angles and plaiting them obliquely
back for an inch into the completed surface. Checked weaving
and plaiting is employed in a variety of ways, for aside from
mattings it enter into the construction of baskets, pouches, bags,
sails, raincoats, baby's hoods, and a number of other articles.</p>

alt="Another type of loom" title="Another type of loom" /></a></p>

<p class="caption">FIGURE 4.&mdash;ANOTHER TYPE OF LOOM.</p>

<p>Cedar bark which has been softened and shredded plays an
important part in the clothing of this region, especially in
blankets like that in <a href="#figure4">Figure 4</a>. The blanket here, however, is
not of cedar bark but of goat's hair for a number of materials
are made use of by this technic. In this weaving the warps are
not thrown over the crossbeam as in the other loom but are
supported on a cord which itself is bound to the beam by
another cord. Neither are the warps united by a strip of weft
running over and under but by a two strand weft element which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
twines about the warps. To my knowledge this form of weaving
has never been reproduced by machinery as no machine can make
threads twine. The blankets of cedar bark are undecorated,
but those of wool frequently have strands of another color
passed across the surface and caught into the weaving from time
to time, producing similar designs to that in <a href="#figure4">Figure 4</a>. As
observed in the illustration the lines of weft are not driven
home but are set some distance apart, the space between varying
on different garments. At the lower edge, however, there
is frequently found a band of closely woven twining, at other
times a band of fur, or a long fringe may complete the edge.</p>

alt="Unfinished Chilkat blanket" title="Unfinished Chilkat blanket" /></a></p>

<p class="caption">FIGURE 5.&mdash;UNFINISHED CHILKAT BLANKET.</p>

<p>The most beautiful weaving of western British Columbia is the
Chilkat blanket, <a href="#figure5">Figures 5</a> and <a href="#figure6">6</a>, a weaving which is unique in
technic and design, both in primitive and modern textile art. It
is a ceremonial garment and the gorgeous designs in white, blue,
yellow and black are of totemic significance and relate to the
ceremonial life of the Indian. In earliest times this blanket was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
undecorated, a plain field of white; then color was introduced
on the white field in stripes of herring-bone pattern typifying
raven's tail, because similar to the vanes of the tail feathers; and
later the elaborate geometric designs of present day blankets
developed. These designs are first painted upon a pattern board
the size and shape of those which are to appear upon the blanket,
and it is from this pattern board that the squaw weaves her pattern.
But although the woman (<a href="#figure7">Figure 7</a>) does weave the blanket, the
man also has his part in the process as he furnishes the loom,
the pattern board and the skin of the goat. The squaw prepares
all the materials and collects the bark, for the warp is
of shredded two-ply cedar bark wrapped with a thread of wool,
while the weft is entirely of the soft wool of the mountain goat.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>Lieut. <span class="smcap">G.&nbsp;T. Emmons</span> tells us that the goat of this region
abounds in the rugged coast mountains from Puget Sound to
Cook's Inlet, but is unknown on the outlying islands. Its preference
is the glacial belt and snow-fields of the most broken
country and the terraced sides of the precipitous cliffs. It is
gregarious in habit being found in bands of from ten to fifty or
more. From September until April the skin is in prime condition
with an abundance of soft wool under a heavy covering of
long coarse hair; but the hunting is only done in the autumn.
To prepare for the plucking, the skin must be kept wet on the
underside so it is moistened and rolled up for several days, thus
loosening the hold of the fleece. With thumb and fingers of both<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
hands the squaw, seated upon the ground, pushes the fleece from
her, procuring by this process great patches of wool and hair.
Then the hairs are plucked out and thrown away and the wool
is ready to be spun. During the spinning the woman also sits
upon the ground with legs outstretched, with the crude wool
by her left side within easy reach. This she draws out with
her left hand and feeds to her right, in the amount necessary to
form the required size of thread. As it is received between the
palm of the right hand and the right thigh, it is rolled from the
body and falls to the side in loose, connected thread. This soft
thread is next spun between the palm of the hand and the
thigh to form a single tightly twisted strand; and by the same
process two of these strands are rolled together to form the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
weft thread for the blanket. In technic the blanket is related
to the last one described for it is a twine weaving, but a twilled
twine as the two strand weft encloses two warps at a move and
with each succeeding line of weft advances one warp giving
the surface a twilled effect. It is interesting that the small
blocks of design are woven separately something as a tapestry,
and later the blocks are sewed together with a thread of sinew
from the caribou or whale.</p>

<p>The weaving from this region which most nearly approaches
machine work in process of making is the dog-hair and goat's
wool blanket. It is woven upon a loom of two revolving cylindrical
beams, supported by upright posts at either end (<a href="#figure8">Figure
8</a>). The end of the warp thread is attached to a staying cord
stretched from post to post about midway between the revolving
beams. The warp then encircles the loom, catches under
the staying cord, then turns and travels back to its starting point,
there to catch under the staying cord and repeat the operation.
The weft moves across the warps as in twilled cloth, over two,
under two, with an advance of one warp at each line of weft.
Dog's hair, duck down and goat's wool are the materials used,
especially the latter. These materials are spun in two-ply
thread twisted partly upon the thigh of the weaver and finished
on a spindle.</p>

<p>Leaving this weaving area in western British Columbia we
pass to the other locality of note in North America where primitive
weaving is practised,&mdash;in southwestern United States and
northern Mexico. Here the loom work is at a more advanced
stage of development than that of the northern area, the
weavers making use of a loom frame, sheds, healds, batten and
an improvised shuttle. The Navajo Indians are the most skilled
weavers north of Mexico and a description of their weaving is
fairly typical of this area. As the warps are of soft pliable
threads they must of necessity be stretched between two beams.
These are suspended vertically if the weaving is to be of any
great size, the distance between them being that of the proposed
length of the blanket (<a href="#figure9">Figure 9</a>). The warp threads are not
stretched across the beams with an oval movement but are laced
over them, forming two sheds, the upper of which is held intact
by means of the shed-rod, and the lower by a set of healds
passing over a heald-rod. A wooden fork serves as a reed and
a slender twig as a shuttle. Upon this twig is loosely wound
from end to end the weft thread. The shuttle at one move
crosses less than half of the warps as the batten&mdash;a flat stick of
hard oak&mdash;is too short to open more than that length of the
shed for the passage of the shuttle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>In <a href="#figure10">Figure 10</a> only a portion of a blanket from the Hopi
Indians is shown, that the delicate design may be better seen.
A number of Hopi patterns have this fine white line of tracery
upon the dark background and it is this play of the fine line
pattern on the fabric which is one of the chief beauties of Hopi
weavings. The sparkle of white is even more brilliant in <a href="#figure11">Figure
11</a>, another smaller weaving from the same people. They
make constant use of the diagonal or twilled technic, a weave
which requires that the warps be divided into four sheds, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
upper supplied with a shed stick, the three lower with healds.
The sheds are shifted in a variety of orders for the construction
of different patterns.</p>

<p class="caption">FIGURE 13.&mdash;HUICHOL WEAVING.</p>

<p>One of the most beautiful weavings the writer has ever seen
from the southwest is that pictured in <a href="#figure12">Figure 12</a>, which is, however,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
only a small center portion of the beautiful serape from
Mexico. The pattern in two colors of indigo upon a tan
colored ground is especially effective, while the tiny blue dots
sprinkled upon the tan surface and the tan dots over the blue
design add a subtle and delightful charm not frequently met
with.</p>

<p>The last two examples, <a href="#figure13">Figures 13</a> and <a href="#figure14">14</a>, are also from
Mexico, the first a bit of weaving with animal designs from the
Huichol Indians, and the last a belt loom from the same people.
In making belts and other narrow fabrics the loom is either
horizontal or oblique in position, stretching from some post or
tree to the weaver and there attached to a loop which passes
either about the waist or under the thighs and rendered tense
by the weight of the weaver. These belts may be woven with
two or four sheds according to the style of weaving desired,
while another method of pattern work on two shed weaving has
the addition of a round stick run into the warps so as to raise
certain threads while the weft passes two or three times underneath
producing a variety of damask weaving.</p>

<p>The stretch between these simple methods of primitive
peoples and machine methods of modern life is great indeed
and we will long continue to wonder that with such crude
devices these people could produce results which compare
favorably with our modern weavings.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
